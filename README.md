# TONalytica User Guide

[TONalytica](https://tonalytica.redoubt.online/) is a web-based platform that allows you to query TON blockchain data and aggregate it into beautiful 
dashboards.

TON are open and transparent, but TVM blockchains are uniqueâ€”making it difficult to understand, ingest, and aggregate data. TONalytica gives you the proper tools to analyze cross-chain data for different tokens, wallets, and protocols. You can also easily share your work with the community.

### Enjoy the power and comfort of TONalytica's query editor with powerful collaboration:

- Write queries in their natural syntax and explore schemas
- Live auto-complete and keyboard shortcuts
- Create snippets for elements you frequently use
- Results are cached for minimal running times
- Schedule auto-update times for results you rely on
- Use query results as data sources to join different databases
